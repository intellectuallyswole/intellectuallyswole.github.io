For financial advantage/business opportunity? Don&amp;rsquo;t. There was a study I saw (which I can&amp;rsquo;t find now) which compared the cost of reaching fluency (based on State Department estimates for how many hours of study required), compared with the economic benefits of having &amp;ldquo;fluent in mandarin&amp;rdquo; on a resume, and it was a net negative for Chinese. The most effective language to learn for native English speakers (economic/compensation advantage to knowing the language, divided by cost of language acquisition) is Norwegian.</description></item></channel></rss>
