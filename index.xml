&lt;p>For financial advantage/business opportunity? &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong>. There was a study I saw (which I can&amp;rsquo;t find now) which compared the cost of reaching fluency (based on State Department estimates for how many hours of study required), compared with the economic benefits of having &amp;ldquo;fluent in mandarin&amp;rdquo; on a resume, and it was a net negative for Chinese. The most effective language to learn for native English speakers (economic/compensation advantage to knowing the language, divided by cost of language acquisition) is Norwegian. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many people who speak both, it&amp;rsquo;s close to English, and the Norwegian economy is bumpin&amp;rsquo;. To add, various Chinese policies (such as the 51% joint venture/IP sharing, and Government preference for local operations) make it difficult for foreigners to make a lot of money in business in China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.unconsciousbios.com/posts/2024-12-30-corporate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unconsciousbios.com/posts/2024-12-30-corporate/</guid><description>&lt;p>layout: post

&lt;p>Over the course of my career I have often been in conversations with colleagues who lament how corporate our employer is becoming. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re Microsoft now&amp;rdquo; was a recurring refrain during my time at Facebook, from 2012 to 2019. Let me explain how &lt;em>feeling&lt;/em> corporate is actually a blessing, because it means you&amp;rsquo;re at a growing company.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
